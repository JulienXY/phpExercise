1. 'front-end-plogg.php' is for front-end test. 'random.php' is the algorithm for back-end test.

2. There is small difference in front-end test because I have make two additional inputs 'Total' and 'Baseline' in navbar in order to integrate the backend test together with the front end. Input exmples: Total=100, Baseline=20, and chose two start date and end date, click 'RECHERCHER' will display the same result as required.
